## Problem Statement

Agriculture is a vital sector of the economy, especially in areas where a large part of the population depends on farming. Farmers and other stakeholders face significant challenges due to the unpredictable prices of essential commodities like pulses and vegetables. These fluctuations in price lead to market volatility, impacting farmers' incomes and consumers' purchasing power. Contributing factors include supply chain disruptions, weather conditions, and changes in demand.

Despite efforts to regulate agricultural production and supply, stakeholders often lack effective tools to make data-driven decisions for pricing, buffer stock management, and timely market interventions. Our solution addresses this gap by offering a data-driven approach to forecasting prices.

## Solution Overview

We propose an AI-ML-based price prediction model for agri-horticultural commodities. By analyzing historical data, real-time market trends, and supply chain information, our model will accurately forecast the prices of commodities such as pulses and vegetables. Key components of the solution include:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering historical prices, weather data, and supply-demand metrics from various sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing it for effective analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting critical features like weather conditions, supply chain data, and historical trends.
- **Model Training**: Utilizing Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, Random Forest, XGBoost) to train the model on past data for accurate future predictions.
- **Price Prediction**: Allowing users to input external factors or upload data to refine predictions.
- **Visualization**: Displaying insights via interactive graphs and tables to support strategic decision-making.

By using this predictive model, stakeholders can make more informed decisions, ultimately leading to a stable and efficient agricultural market.

## Workflow

The solution operates through a well-defined pipeline as outlined below:

1. **Data Collection**  
   Collects historical price data, market supply-demand metrics, and weather data from sources like government databases and APIs.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Cleans and formats raw data to handle missing values, normalize variables, and prepare data for model input.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Extracts key factors impacting prices, including seasonal patterns, weather conditions, and market indicators.

4. **Model Training**  
   Trains the model using algorithms like ARIMA, Random Forest, and XGBoost, analyzing historical trends to predict future prices.

5. **Price Prediction**  
   Generates commodity price predictions over a selected timeframe based on real-time and historical data.

6. **Visualization and Decision Support**  
   Visualizes predictions via interactive charts, highlighting key insights such as "best time to sell" and "expected price trends."

## Expected Outcomes

The AI-ML-based price prediction model aims to provide several impactful outcomes:

- **Accurate Price Forecasting**: Delivers reliable price predictions for commodities, aiding in timely and informed decisions by farmers, traders, and government agencies.
- **Market Stability**: Helps reduce volatility in agricultural markets, supporting better planning and strategic interventions.
- **Enhanced Farmer Decision-Making**: Provides farmers with insights to determine the best time to sell, increasing their income and reducing risk from price fluctuations.
- **Support for Government Agencies**: Assists in managing buffer stocks, market interventions, and ensuring the affordability of essential commodities.
- **Supply Chain Optimization**: Integrates real-time data to optimize logistics, ensuring demand fulfillment without surplus or shortage issues.
- **Future Integration with Real-Time Data**: Keeps the system adaptable to dynamic market conditions, ensuring ongoing value for agricultural planning.
